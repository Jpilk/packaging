Notes:
  * Tested on Fedora, CentOS (RHEL work-alike) systems for x86
    and Fedora for arm.  Untested on SUSE.
  * Fedora and CentOS 7 (and SUSE) build for modern (systemd)
    init systems with service definitions.  CentOS 6 builds for
    the legacy sysv init scripts
  * Patches welcome.




To build an RPM

First, choose build process.  MOCK, or RPMBUILD

If you are not sure what you want, you likely want RPMBUILD.


-----

MOCK build:

Requirements:

* Fedora or RHEL/CentOS system for x86_64, and a Fedora arm system
  (RHEL does not currently support arm).

* Install mock, rpm-build, and enable your build user to run mock.


To use:

* cd to this directory

* Copy the current (distribution) hdhomerun_record_linux_<version> binary to SOURCES/

* Run 'BUILD_RPMS <version>' on a Fedora system x86_64 system, and
  seperately on a armv7hl system

* Copy binary rpms in RPMS/ to distribution point(s)

-----

RPMBUILD build:

* cd to this directory

* Copy the current (distribution) hdhomerun_record_linux_<version> binary to SOURCES/

* Choose the architecture (for <arch> below).  i686 or armv7hl.

* Run 'rpmbuild --define "_topdir ${PWD}" --define "HDHRDVR_VERSION <version>" --target=<arch> -bb SPECS/hdhomerun_record.spec'

* RPMS/<arch> will contain your rpms
