Notes:
  * Tested on Fedora, CentOS (RHEL work-alike) systems for x86
    and Fedora for arm.  Untested on SUSE.  Untested on ppc arch.
  * Fedora and CentOS 7 (and SUSE) build for modern (systemd)
    init systems with service definitions.  CentOS 6 builds for
    the legacy sysv init scripts.
  * Building supports (and for distributor builds utilizes) cross
    building.  Technically, both EL nor Fedora requires native
    builds.  However, (a) these are not official EL/Fedora
    packages, and (b) we do not build the binary, just extract
    the binary from the distribution point.
  * Patches welcome.




Quick reference to build an RPM

First, choose build process.  MOCK, or RPMBUILD

If you are building only for one (your) system, RPMBUILD is easier.


-----

MOCK all architecture build for distributors:

Requirements:

* (Usually) a current Fedora or CentOS system running x86_64

* Install mock, rpm-build, and enable your build user to run mock.

To use:

* cd to this directory

* (Optional) copy the current (distribution) hdhomerun_record_linux_<version> binary to SOURCES/
  (BUILD_RPMS will attempt to download the source directly from SiliconDust)

* Run 'BUILD_RPMS <version>' on a Fedora x86_64 system

* Copy binary rpms in RPMS/ to distribution point(s)

-----

RPMBUILD build:

Requirements:

* A number of packages are required to build the rpm. Use
    rpmspec -q --buildrequires [--target=<arch>] SPECS/hdhomerun-record.spec
  to determine the build requirements (--target=<arch> for cross building)

To use:

* cd to this directory

* Copy the current (distribution) hdhomerun_record_linux_<version> binary to SOURCES/

* Run 'rpmbuild --define "_topdir ${PWD}" --define "HDHRDVR_VERSION <version>" [--target=<arch>] -bb SPECS/hdhomerun-record.spec'
  (include --target=<arch> if you are going a cross build to the non-native architecture)

* RPMS/<arch> will contain your rpms
