Tools to build MythTV rpms

NOTE:  The BUILD_MYTHTV_RPMS command uses mockchain, of which the upstream
       is currently broken.  You must manually create your own copy of
       mockchain (and make sure it is in your path) with the proposed fixes
       from issue #65 from the rpm-software-management/mock github repo.
       ref: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/issues/65# 

NOTE:  With the latest FFmpeg in master (targeted to be version 30) the EL7
       version of libvpx is too old.  The local definition of the centos
       repository includes a COPR reference that will support compilation.
       To install the EL7 RPMs, you will (likely) need to add that COPR
       (or some equivalent) to your system (`yum copr enable gtb/libvpx`)
       before installation.

Examples:

  Build latest fixes/29 for Fedora 28:

    ./BUILD_MYTHTV_RPMS -r /etc/mock/fedora-28-x86_64-rpmfusion_free.cfg fixes/29

  Build latest fixes/29 for centos 7:

    ./BUILD_MYTHTV_RPMS -r build_cfgs/centos-7-x86_64-rpmfusion_free.cfg fixes/29

  Build master for Fedora 28:

    ./BUILD_MYTHTV_RPMS -r /etc/mock/fedora-28-x86_64-rpmfusion_free.cfg master
